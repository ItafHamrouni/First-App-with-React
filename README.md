Hola Guys !

This is my first App with React ! 

I wanted to turn my React knowledge  into a simple App which contains 3 components : 
1. App.js contains the state, functions(addItem, deleteItem) and the call of the other components with passing props into each one
2. TodoItems took the list from App and do listing with function map. It contins also call of deleteItem function
3. AddItems contains initial state and return the input items. Also it gives the necessary functions (handleChange, handleSubmit) and also call of addItem function
4. It is prefer to put the components into into a folder named commponents with a his own .css  

Else you can put the css into  index.css to make all the front for your App. You can be creative and designed as you want !
